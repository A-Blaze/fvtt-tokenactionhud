# Token Action HUD
This is a FoundryVTT module which populates a floating HUD showing actions for a selected token. The information displayed depends on the system. For DND5e, for example, it currently shows items and equipment, feats, abilities, skills, and spells.

# Installation
1. Inside Foundry's Configuration and Setup screen, go to **Add-on Modules**
2. Click "Install Module"
3. In the Manifest URL field paste: `https://github.com/espositos/fvtt-tokenactionhud/raw/master/module.json`
4. Within the game, click on **Settings** -> **Manage Modules** and make sure the Token Action Hud is enabled.

# Usage
Once activated, selecting a token that has an actor/character sheet associated with it and that you have permission to control should display an an action bar that is populated with the actions and abilities available for that token.

# Supported systems
* DND5e
* WFRP4e (basic)
* Any other system? I believe the HUD is modular enough that if anyone would like to help me add support for another system, it will hopefully be relatively painless. Please approach me on the Foundry Discord - or feel free to take the code and go your own way.

# Support
For questions, feature requests, or bug reports, feel free to contact me on the Foundry Discord (^ and stick#0520) or open an issue here directly.

# Thanks
Enormous thanks goes to the following people for their help in getting the HUD to its current state:
Kekilla#7036, Skimble#8601, Forien#2130, and the Fabricator General, as well as any other module developers who I have pilfered code and ideas from (KaKaRoTo).
